## Repository Structure

Each individual submission is located in a folder named with the respected Kattis Problem ID.

The folder contains the following files:

- The actual sorce code, named index.js.

- A nested folder with the Sample Data, if any exists.

- A detailed Read Me file, containing the explanation of the problem and the solution.

- A package.json file to provide version control and package management, if any of such is used.

### NotƒÅre 
*I am always striving towards getting a deeper knowledge, a better understanding and a wider experience with programming.*

*Should you therefor have any suggestions, comments or general criticism regarding my submissions, please leave a comment as critique is something I value greatly.*
